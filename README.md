# K-Means Algorithm Repository

Welcome to the K-Means Algorithm repository, an integral part of my exploration into machine learning algorithms, as documented on my blog [Data Science For Lifelong Learning](https://datasciencelifelonglearn.blogspot.com). This space is meticulously curated to offer both novices and experts a deep understanding of the K-Means clustering algorithm, its applications, and its significance in the realm of unsupervised learning.

## Overview

The K-Means algorithm stands as one of the pillars of clustering techniques in machine learning. It operates on the principle of centroid-based clustering, aiming to partition a dataset into distinct, non-overlapping subgroups where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. This repository not only provides a hands-on Python implementation of the K-Means algorithm but also delves into its underlying mechanics, strengths, and potential areas of improvement. Through a combination of theoretical exposition and practical demonstration, the content here aims to offer a holistic understanding of K-Means.


## Repository Structure

- **[Implementation](./Implementation/Readme.md)**: A detailed exposition of the K-Means algorithm, discussing its methodology, applications, and nuances.

- **[Code](./Implementation/Code/)**: Python scripts that implement the K-Means algorithm. For a detailed breakdown of the codebase, refer to the [Code Readme](./Implementation/Code/Readme.md).
  
- **[Images](./Images/)**: Contains visual assets and graphical results pertinent to the K-Means algorithm.

## Python Implementation

The codebase is meticulously structured to ensure clarity, modularity, and ease of adaptation.

- **Data Synthesis**: [data_generation.py](./Implementation/Code/data_generation.py)
- **K-Means Logic**: [k_means_function.py](./Implementation/Code/k_means_function.py)
- **Visualization**: [plotting_results.py](./Implementation/Code/plotting_results.py)
- **Demonstration**: [k_means_demo.py](./Implementation/Code/k_means_demo.py)
