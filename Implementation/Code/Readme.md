# K-Means Algorithm: Codebase Overview

Welcome to the technical segment of my K-Means repository. Herein, I've presented Python scripts that operationalize the K-Means algorithm. Whether you're well-versed in coding or are in the nascent stages of your programming journey, I've endeavored to ensure these scripts are both informative and accessible.

## Directory Contents

- **data-generation.py**: This script is responsible for generating datasets tailored for clustering demonstrations.
- **helper-functions.py**: A compilation of utility functions, essential for the seamless execution of the K-Means algorithm.
- **k-means-implementation.py**: The central script, encapsulating the core mechanics and logic of the K-Means algorithm.
- **plotting-results.py**: A dedicated module for visualizing the clustering outcomes, offering a visual narrative of the algorithm's efficacy.

## Usage Guidelines

1. Ensure the prerequisite Python libraries are installed.
2. Commence with `data-generation.py` to produce the requisite dataset.
3. Progress to `k-means-implementation.py` to witness the clustering process.
4. Conclude with `plotting-results.py` for a visual representation of the results.
